# mac-install-scripts
A set of scripts to make customizing new macs easier. This is designed for me and probably doesn't suit your purposes

Use:
```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jhorowitz/mac-install-scripts/master/install.sh | bash | bash
```

To do a try run and see what it will be doing, remove the second pipe to bash
